# Text Adventure
This is my second game ever, but this time I coded it alone!

It's a pretty small text adventure.
It was pretty fun trying to find ways of solving some problems when coding.
Once again, this game runs using Poetry. 

To play the game:
```
poetry install
```
And then:
```
poetry run teagea
```
I've also included a .txt file of how I brainstormed this game, if you're curious
